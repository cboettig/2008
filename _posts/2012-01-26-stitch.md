Sometimes we just want to run the code in an R script to create a report. Indeed you can paste the code in an R console, and copy the results. This is often very messy (code mangled with results), and most importantly, you lose the graphics output. So **knitr** introduced a function `stitch()` to conveniently insert an R script into a template to create a simple report, preserving everything in the R output (either text results or plots). See `?stitch` for details.

There are a LaTeX template and an HTML template in **knitr**. The former can produce a PDF document, and the latter can produce an HTML page. My motivation of this function is to make it easier for students to turn their R scripts into reports (e.g. homework) quickly. The traditional way is usually they run code in R, do the tedious job of collecting results line by line, copy and paste them into (ugly-looking) MS Word. With this funciton, they can either turn in the PDF document, or publish the HTML pages on the web.

The usage is simple: just provide the path of the R script as the first argument to `stitch()`. It uses the LaTeX template by default.
