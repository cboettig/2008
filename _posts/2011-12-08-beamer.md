It is straightforward to use Sweave or **knitr** with beamer; the only thing you need to be careful of is you have to add the `fragile` option to the frames that contain verbatim code. For LyX users, it is not that easy at the moment but is possible anyway; see FAQ 1 in the [official LyX manual for Sweave](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/lyx/sweave.pdf).

- A minimal beamer example for **knitr**
  - Rnw source: [knitr-beamer.Rnw](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-beamer.Rnw)
  - LyX source: [knitr-beamer.lyx](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-beamer.lyx)
  - PDF output: [knitr-beamer.pdf](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-beamer.pdf)
- A simplified version of the above example:
  - Rnw source: [knitr-beamer2.Rnw](https://gist.github.com/1803930)

One note on the Rnw source -- I used this in the preamble:

{% highlight latex %}
\ifdefined\knitrout
  \renewenvironment{knitrout}{\begin{footnotesize}}{\end{footnotesize}}
\else
\fi
{% endhighlight %}

It will wrap the **knitr** output in a `footnotesize` environment, because all the output is wrapped in a `knitrout` environment by default, and we only need to redefine this environment to customize the style of output. Accordingly, in the Rnw document, I have an option `size='footnotesize'`, which will be passed to the **highlight** package to determine the font size of some characters in the highlighted code, e.g. the prompt character `>`. In this example, the `size` option is useless since I did not use prompt characters (`prompt=FALSE` by default); some users may be more comfortable with prompt characters, then it will be useful to set the `size` option accordingly. See the [options](/knitr/options) page.
