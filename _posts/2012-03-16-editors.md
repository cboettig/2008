I have written about [LyX](../lyx/), [RStudio](../rstudio/), [Emacs Org-mode](../org/) and [Eclipse](../eclipse/). There are still other editors that we can use with **knitr**, such as [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) and WinEdt. The key is that you call R and load the **knitr** package, then call the function `knit()` or `knit2pdf()`.

## Texmaker

You can define a custom command to process Rnw documents by `User --> User Commands --> Edit User Commands`:

Note if you have not added R's bin path to the `PATH` variable, you need to use the full path to `Rscript.exe` in the above command like:

    "C:/Program Files/R/R-2.14.2/bin/Rscript.exe" -e "knitr::knit2pdf('%.Rnw')"

If you do know where is `Rscript.exe`, simply open R and use `R.home('bin')` to find it. Then for an Rnw document, you can use this `knitr` command to compile it:

Click the arrow on the left to compile the document, and the right arrow to view PDF. Of course the above configuration is for Windows, but it is straightforward for other systems as well: change `Rscript.exe` to `Rscript` (in fact you can use `Rscript` under Windows as well).

## WinEdt

The following instructions were from [Phil Chalmers](https://github.com/philchalmers), and I did not test them at all, but I feel it should be in the ballpark.

1. Go to `Options -> Execution Modes -> PDFTeXify`. Then look for executable `Rscript.exe` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\R\R-2.14.2\bin\Rscript.exe`) and select that.
2. under `Switches` put `-e`, and under `Parameters` put `"knitr::knit2pdf('%n%t')"`

Now hitting `F9` will run everything for you at once, including opening up the PDF.

Thanks, Phil.
