As introduced in the [main manual](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-manual.pdf), **knitr** uses the **evaluate** package to evaluate R code chunks, and there are six types of output: source code, normal text output, messages, warnings, errors and plots. Below we give a summary on the fine control over them.

1. source code: use chunk option `echo`, e.g. `echo=FALSE` hides the R code
1. normal text output: use option `results` (`markup` marks up the results; `asis` return texts as-is; `hide` hides the results)
1. messages: option `message` (`FALSE` hides messages)
1. warnings: option `warning` (`FALSE` hides warnings)
1. errors: option `error` (`FALSE` hides error messages)
1. plots: option `fig.keep` (`none` discards all plots; `low` for all plots including low-level plots; `high` for high-level plots)

These options are orthogonal to each other, so you are free to turn on/off one type of output without affecting other pieces.

By default, `echo` and `eval` can take values from an R expression, which brings the feature of conditional evaluation introduced in the main manual. In short, `eval=dothis` means the real value of `eval` is taken from a variable named `dothis` in the global environment; by manipulating this variable, we can turn on/off the evaluation of a batch of chunks.

## Advanced usage of the `echo` option

Besides `TRUE/FALSE`, the chunk option `echo` can also take a numeric vector to selectively echo source code in the output. This vector indexes the complete R expresions in the code chunk, e.g. `echo=1` means only include the first expression in the output. Below is a complete example:

{% highlight r %}
<<hide-par, echo=3:4>>=
## 'ugly' code that I do not want to show
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1), cex.lab = 0.95, cex.axis = 0.9, 
    mgp = c(2, 0.7, 0), tcl = -0.3) 
plot(mtcars[, 1:2])
plot(mtcars[, 4:5])
@
{% endhighlight %}

The `par()` expression is not essential to this code chunk, and it is even distracting to the readers, so we may want to hide it in the output. In this particular case, we do not want the first expression (comments) either; `echo=3:4` means the third and fourth expressions are to be included in the output. Note the index of an expression is not necessarily the same as its line number. Alternatively, we can use `echo=-(1:2)` to remove the first two expressions.

R code for `echo` that contains commas is not syntactically valid, e.g. `echo=c(1, 3)`. It may be confusing to the reader if you select a discrete subset of the source code; often times we should use `a:b` or `-(a:b)` to select a (relatively) complete subset. If you really want to select an arbitrary subset, you can use a global variable like:

{% highlight r %}
<<set-echo, echo=FALSE>>=
my.echo.idx = c(3, 5) # select 3rd and 5th expressions
@
<<hide-par, echo=my.echo.idx>>=
## 'ugly' code that I do not want to show
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1), cex.lab = 0.95, cex.axis = 0.9, 
    mgp = c(2, 0.7, 0), tcl = -0.3) 
plot(mtcars[, 1:2])
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 0.5)) # reset margins
plot(mtcars[, 4:5])
@
{% endhighlight %}

## One comment on messages

Many people like to use `cat()` to write messages in R, and this is a very bad practice, because it is inconvenient to turn off such messages. When we really mean _messages_, we should use `message()`. These regular messages can be conveniently suppressed by `suppressMessages()` or captured by **knitr**. Some package authors did not seem to pay attention to this issue; when we load a package or use functions in a package, we may see fake messages that cannot be supppressed. If a startup message is really necessary, it should be put in `packageStartupMessage()`. When you are unable to turn off some messages by `message=FALSE` in **knitr**, it is probably time to request the package authors to make some changes.

Similarly, we should use `warning()` when we really mean a warning.

So watch out your `cat`s!
