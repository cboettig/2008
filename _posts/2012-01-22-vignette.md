Currently R can only use Sweave to build package vignettes, so if we want to build vignettes with **knitr**, we have to use some tricks. One way to do this is through a Makefile, which will be used by `R CMD build` when building vignettes. In this Makefile, we can set our rules to create the PDF file using a custom tool like **knitr**.

## How knitr's vignette is built

To illustrate that a Makefile is plausible to build a vignette with **knitr**, this package itself has provided a vignette built with a Makefile; see the [inst/doc/](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/inst/doc) directory for the source code.

The basic idea is to use `Rscript` with an argument `-e` to execute an R expression, and the R code in the Makefile should be self-explanatory. I followed Ross Ihaka's [tutorial](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~stat782/downloads/make-tutorial.pdf) and used a variable `PDFS` in the Makefile, so if you want to build more PDF's, you just add their names to `PDFS`.

## A few comments

Now I tend not to put the real vignettes in my packages for the reasons below:

1. It takes more time to check and compile on CRAN; yes I can turn on cache, but the cache files are like pollution to the package source and I want a clean package;
1. PDF vignettes are often too big compared to other files in the package (e.g. R source code), so I do not want to bring extra burden to our CRAN hosts, knowing that the number of packages has been growing exponentially;
1. I can keep track of the number of downloads when I put them in GitHub whereas I can know little information from CRAN;

So I just went green.

I thank Carl Boettiger, Ross Ihaka and Andrew Redd for their Makefile examples.
