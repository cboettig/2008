Like the command `\SweaveInput{}` in Sweave, **knitr** also has the similar functionality, which enables us to insert child documents into a main document. The idea is like the command `\input{}` or `\include{}` in LaTeX to manage a large document in smaller parts.

Sweave searches for `\SweaveInput{}` in the main document, and weaves the child documents, whereas **knitr** does not search for such character strings, instead, you can directly use `\Sexpr{}` with the function `knit_child()` to input a child document.

For example, we have a main document named [`knitr-input.Rnw`](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-input.Rnw) here:

{% highlight tex %}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

<<test-main>>=
options(width = 60)
summary(iris)
@

Let's see how to work with child documents in knitr. Below we input
the file \textsf{knitr-input-child.Rnw}:

\Sexpr{knit_child('knitr-input-child.Rnw')}

Done!

\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

We want to include a child document [`knitr-input-child.Rnw`](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-input-child.Rnw) in it:

{% highlight r %}
This chunk below is from the child document.

<<test-child, out.width=2in>>=
1+1
rnorm(5)
plot(1)
boxplot(1:10)
str(mtcars)
@
{% endhighlight %}

The function `knit_child()` is just a wrapper to `knit()` and returns an appropriate character string to insert into the output document (in this case it is `\input{knitr-input-child.tex}`). You only need to call:

{% highlight r %}
library(knitr)
knit('knitr-input.Rnw')
{% endhighlight %}

You can freely nest one Rnw document in the other, as long as the nested structure is clear in your mind. This sounds like the movie [Inception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception).
