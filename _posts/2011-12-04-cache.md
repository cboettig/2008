We can use the chunk option `cache=TRUE` to enable cache, and the option `prefix.cache` can be used to set the cache directory. See the [options](/knitr/options) page.

- Bayesian Lasso
  - Rnw source: [Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.Rnw](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.Rnw) (requires three add-on packages: **ggplot2**, **lasso2** and **mvtnorm**; [data source](https://github.com/ggobi/cranvas/raw/2c34d81c29369b29c281206c9733fbc7c19509b4/data/nrcstat.rda); you may need to revise the R code in the Rnw document if you do not know how to install the **cranvas** package, e.g. use `load('nrcstat.rda')`)
