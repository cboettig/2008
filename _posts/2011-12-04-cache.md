We can use the chunk option `cache=TRUE` to enable cache, and the option `cache.path` can be used to set the cache directory. See the [options](/knitr/options) page.

## Cache examples

Two examples:

- a minimal example
  - a naive tex example: [knitr-latex\_knit\_.tex](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-latex_knit_.tex)
- Bayesian Lasso
  - Rnw source: [Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.Rnw](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.Rnw) (requires three add-on packages: **ggplot2**, **lasso2** and **mvtnorm**; [data source](https://github.com/ggobi/cranvas/raw/2c34d81c29369b29c281206c9733fbc7c19509b4/data/nrcstat.rda); you may need to revise the R code in the Rnw document if you do not know how to install the **cranvas** package, e.g. use `load('nrcstat.rda')`)
  - PDF output: [Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.pdf](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.pdf)
  - the Gibbs sampler may take quite a few seconds, so you have to wait for the first time, but the next time when you knit it again, it will be very fast since the time-consuming chunks are skipped

## Important notes

You have to read the section on cache in the [main manual](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-manual.pdf) very carefully to understand when cache will be rebuilt and which chunks should not be cached.

Let me repeat the three factors that can affect cache (any change on them will invalidate old cache):

1. all chunk options except `include`; e.g. change `tidy=TRUE` to `FALSE` will break the old cache, but changing `include` will not
1. R code in a chunk; a tiny change in the R code will lead to removal of old cache, even if it is a change of a space or an empty line
1. the R option `width` (`getOption('width')`)

It is extremely important to note that usually a chunk that has side-effects should _not_ be cached. Although **knitr** tries to retain the side-effects from `print()`, there are still other side-effects that are not preserved. Here are some cases that you must not use cache for a chunk:

1. setting R options like `options('width')` or `pdf.options()` or any other options in **knitr** like `opts_chunk$set()`, `opts_knit$set()` and `knit_hooks$set()`
2. load a package `library(foobar)`
3. `source()` a script in which the code contains operations in the above two items; if `source()` is used only for creating new objects, it is safe to be cached

Otherwise next time the chunk will be skipped and all the settings in it will be ignored. You have to use `cache=FALSE` explicitly for these chunks.
