We can use the chunk option `cache=TRUE` to enable cache, and the option `cache.path` can be used to set the cache directory. See the [options](/knitr/options) page.

## Cache examples

The cache feature is used extensively in many of my documents, e.g. you can find it in the **knitr** [main manual](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/manual/) or its [graphics manual](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/graphics/). Here are two additional examples:

- a minimal example
  - a naive tex example: [knitr-latex\_knit\_.tex](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-latex_knit_.tex)
- Bayesian Lasso
  - Rnw source: [Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.Rnw](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.Rnw) (requires three add-on packages: **ggplot2**, **lasso2** and **mvtnorm**),  [data source](https://github.com/ggobi/cranvas/raw/2c34d81c29369b29c281206c9733fbc7c19509b4/data/nrcstat.rda) (you may need to revise the R code in the Rnw document if you do not know how to install the **cranvas** package, e.g. use `load('nrcstat.rda')`) and [bibliography]((https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.bib)
  - PDF output: [Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.pdf](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.pdf)
  - LyX source: [Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.lyx](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/Stat615-Report1-Yihui-Xie.lyx)
  - the Gibbs sampler may take quite a few seconds, so you have to wait for the first time, but the next time when you knit it again, it will be very fast since the time-consuming chunks are skipped

## Important notes

You have to read the section on cache in the [main manual](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-manual.pdf) very carefully to understand when cache will be rebuilt and which chunks should not be cached.

Let me repeat the three factors that can affect cache (any change on them will invalidate old cache):

1. all chunk options except `include`; e.g. change `tidy=TRUE` to `FALSE` will break the old cache, but changing `include` will not
1. R code in a chunk; a tiny change in the R code will lead to removal of old cache, even if it is a change of a space or an empty line
1. the R option `width` (`getOption('width')`)

It is extremely important to note that usually a chunk that has side-effects should _not_ be cached. Although **knitr** tries to retain the side-effects from `print()`, there are still other side-effects that are not preserved. Here are some cases that you must not use cache for a chunk:

1. setting R options like `options('width')` or `pdf.options()` or any other options in **knitr** like `opts_chunk$set()`, `opts_knit$set()` and `knit_hooks$set()`
3. `source()` a script (**knitr** is unable to know which objects are created by `source()` unless you point it to a correct environment; see below)

Otherwise next time the chunk will be skipped and all the settings in it will be ignored. You have to use `cache=FALSE` explicitly for these chunks.

## Even more stuff for cache?

While the above objects seem reasonable to affect cache, reproducible research may be even more rigorous in the sense that cache can be invalidated by other changes. One typical example is the version of software; it is not impossible for two different versions of R to give you different results. In this case, we may set

{% highlight r %}
opts_knit$set(cache.extra = R.version.string)
opts_knit$set(cache.extra = R.version) # or even consider platform
{% endhighlight %}

so the cached results are only applicable to a specific version of R. When you upgrade R and recompile the document, all the results will be re-computed.

Similarly you can put more variables into this option so that the cache is preserved only given environments. Here is an ambitious example:

{% highlight r %}
## cache is only valid with a specific version of R and session info
## cache will be kept for at most a month (re-compute the next month)
opts_knit$set(cache.extra = list(R.version, sessionInfo(), format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m'))
{% endhighlight %}

## The correct way of using `source()`

It is generally not recommended to use `source()` in a cached chunk, but there are safe ways to call it, through either a custom hook and a chunk option (say, `script`) or the environment `knit_env()`.

### Use `knit_env()` (easier)

The function `knit_env()` returns an environment in which the current chunk is evaluated. It is essentially the same object as the `envir` argument in the chunk hook function, so an easier solution is:

{% highlight r %}
<<run-script, cache=TRUE>>=
source('foo-bar.R', local = knit_env())
@
{% endhighlight %}

### Use a hook (more complicated)

{% highlight r %}
<<script-hook, cache=FALSE>>=
knit_hooks$set(script = function(before, options, envir) {
    if (before && file.exists(options$script)) {
        source(options$script, local = envir)
        NULL # make sure not to write anything in the output
    }
})
@
{% endhighlight %}

The key point is you have to `source()` a script in the correct environment, which is the argument `envir` in this case. This is the environment in which the chunk is evaluated, so **knitr** will be able to know which new objects are created, hence they can be cached. See `?source` for details.

Next for a chunk, you can use the `script` option to specify the path of the R script, e.g.

{% highlight r %}
<<run-script, cache=TRUE, script='foo-bar.R'>>=
## this chunk should not be empty
@
{% endhighlight %}

This is equivalent to calling `source('foo-bar.R')`.

The above example is a rare case of using the argument `envir` in the hook function.

## Caching generic objects

Because `setGeneric()` creates an object in the global environment even if the code is evaluated in a local environment, **knitr** is unable to keep track of generic objects created in this way. However, you can still cache them by telling **knitr** the existence of these objects. See issue [#138](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/138) for a concrete example.
