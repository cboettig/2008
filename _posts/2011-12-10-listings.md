It is easy to define your own output [hooks](/knitr/hooks) in **knitr** to decorate your results with the LaTeX **listings** package. Here is a snippet that you may use:

{% highlight r %}
## a common hook for messages, warnings and errors
hook_lst_bf = function(x, options) {
    paste("\\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\\bfseries}]\n", x, 
        "\\end{lstlisting}\n", sep = "")
}
knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) {
    paste("\\begin{lstlisting}[language=R,numbers=left,stepnumber=2]\n", x, 
        "\\end{lstlisting}\n", sep = "")
}, output = function(x, options) {
    paste("\\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\\ttfamily}]\n", x, 
        "\\end{lstlisting}\n", sep = "")
}, warning = hook_lst_bf, message = hook_lst_bf, error = hook_lst_bf)

## empty highlight header since it is not useful any more
set_header(highlight = "")
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, **knitr** exposes everything to the user. All you need to do is to make sure that these pieces R source and output can be wrapped in proper environments.

Compared to the default highlighting approach, **listings** does not seem to perform well in terms of highlighting keywords like function names. The R package **highlight** parses R code in order to find out all the symbols, so it is more accurate than **listings**, which highlights R code based a limited list of keywords and regular expressions. In the above example, `set.seed` should have been highlighted as a whole symbol. Anyway, the **listings** package seems to be very flexible and I know many users are interested in it (there have been some [hacking results](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/SweaveTemplate/Sweavel.sty) for Sweave), so I provide this simple demo to show how straightforward it is for **knitr** to customize the output with **listings**.
