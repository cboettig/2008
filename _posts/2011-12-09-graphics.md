## The Graphics Manual

The graphics manual shows all cool bells and whistles about graphics in **knitr**.

- Source and output of the graphics manual
  - Rnw source: [knitr-graphics.Rnw](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-graphics.Rnw)
  - LyX source: [knitr-graphics.lyx](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-graphics.lyx)
  - PDF output: [knitr-graphics.pdf](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-graphics.pdf)

You will probably realize how much room there is for improvement of R graphics in publications. Don't accept whatever R gives you; it is time starting making your graphics beautiful and professional.

I'd like to thank the authors of the [`tufte-handout`](http://code.google.com/p/tufte-latex/) class, based on which this document was written, and the **tikzDevice** package makes the font styles in plots consistent with the document class (using serif fonts).

## A note on custom graphical devices

The [chunk option](http://yihui.name/knitr/options) `dev` accepts custom graphical devices which can be defined as an R function with three arguments. Here is an example of a PDF device using `pointsize` 10:

{% highlight r %}
<<custom-dev>>=
my_pdf = function(file, width, height) {
  pdf(file, width = width, height = height, pointsize = 10)
}
@
{% endhighlight %}

There are a whole bunch of options in the `pdf()` function in base R, but **knitr**'s `pdf` device only supports `width` and `height` through options `fig.width` and `fig.height` respectively, so if we want to use other arguments in `pdf()`, we have to define a new device. Then we can use this device in chunk options, but one important thing to remember is to provide the `fig.ext` option at the same time, because **knitr** is unable to guess what should be a correct file extension for the plot file. Finally we will use the custom device like this:

{% highlight r %}
<<dev-demo, dev='my_pdf', fig.ext='pdf'>>=
plot(rnorm(100))
@
{% endhighlight %}

Of course you can set them globally using `\SweaveOpts{}` if you want to use this device through out the document.

## Make the device more extensible

We can actually have even finer control over the above device. Instead of hardcoding `pointsize = 10`, we can add a custom option `pointsize` to the chunk. Here is an example:

{% highlight r %}
<<custom-dev>>=
my_pdf = function(file, width, height) {
  ps = opts_current$get('pointsize')
  if (is.null(ps)) ps = 10  # if not set, use default 10
  pdf(file, width = width, height = height, pointsize = ps)
}
@

<<dev-demo, dev='my_pdf', fig.ext='pdf', pointsize=11>>=
plot(rnorm(100))
@
{% endhighlight %}

The key is to make use of the [object](http://yihui.name/knitr/objects) `opts_current`, which gives us all the options for the current chunk, therefore we can pass the option `pointsize` to the device function. Similarly, if you have other options, you are free to add them to your chunks and pass them to the device by `opts_current`. The other way to pass multiple arguments is to pass them all in a list object, e.g.

{% highlight r %}
<<custom-dev>>=
my_pdf = function(file, width, height) {
  opts = as.list(opts_current$get('dev.opts'))
  opts$file = file; opts$width = width; opts$height = height
  do.call('pdf', opts)
}

<<dev-demo, dev='my_pdf', fig.ext='pdf', dev.opts=list(pointsize=11, family='serif')>>=
plot(rnorm(100))
@
{% endhighlight %}

## Create hyperlinks in R graphics

With the help of the **tikzDevice** package, we can write almost any LaTeX commands in R graphics. Here is an example [links.Rnw](https://gist.github.com/1937313) of writing hyperlinks (courtesy of Jonathan Kennel).

An important note is you have to add `\usepackage{hyperref}` to the list of metrics packages used by **tikzDevice**, otherwise the command `\hyperlink` or `\hypertarget` will not be recognized.
