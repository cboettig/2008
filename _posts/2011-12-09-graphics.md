The graphics manual shows all cool bells and whistles about graphics in **knitr**.

- Source and output of the graphics manual
  - Rnw source: [knitr-graphics.Rnw](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-graphics.Rnw)
  - LyX source: [knitr-graphics.lyx](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-graphics.lyx)
  - PDF output: [knitr-graphics.pdf](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-graphics.pdf)

You will probably realize how much room there is for improvement of R graphics in publications. Don't accept whatever R gives you, and start making your graphics really beautiful and professional.

A few screenshots from the manual:

I'd like to thank the authors of the [`tufte-handout`](http://code.google.com/p/tufte-latex/) class, based on which this document was written, and the **tikzDevice** package makes the font styles in plots consistent with the document class (using serif fonts).
