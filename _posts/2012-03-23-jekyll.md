Some notes for using Jekyll:

    rake theme:switch name=twitter

The `twitter` theme will generate a dynamic menu of pages if added to the group `navigation`.  (Will only appear in alphanumeric ordering though).  Other themes have the menu hardcoded in html, edit the default.html page in `_includes/themes/themename/`.
