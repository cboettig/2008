The function `imgur_upload()` in the **knitr** package enables one to upload images to the image host <imgur.com> in R using the **RCurl** package. If the package [option](/knitr/options) `upload` is `TRUE`, all plots generated in chunks will be uploaded automatically when the output format is HTML or Markdown.

- A simple example
  - source: [knitr-upload\_knit\_.md](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/raw/master/inst/examples/knitr-upload_knit_.md)
  - output: [knitr-upload.md](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-upload.md)
- Two blog posts by Carl Boettiger on how to publish a post to Wordpress.com with knitr and RWordPress purely in R, with images uploaded to
  - [Imgur](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/3974) 
  - or [Flickr](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/3988)

This allows you to publish web pages quickly without worrying about image files; you only need to upload a single HTML (to any web servers) or Markdown file (to GitHub, for example).

Brave professors may encourage their brave students to write homeworks with a simple Markdown file, instead of MS Word (which is usually difficult to reproduce and frustrating to format elegantly).
