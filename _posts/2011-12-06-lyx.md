Currently there are two approaches of using **knitr** in LyX, and the instructions here are based on LyX >= 2.0.2, so you may need to update your LyX version first.

An important note to all LyX users: a big trouble with LyX+Sweave is that we have got too many instructions in the past on how to configure LyX in order to work with Sweave. Now you probably should ignore all of them; many tutorials are becoming misleading and confusing (e.g. you no longer need to take care of `noweb.sty`). The only up-to-date source is the [official LyX manual for Sweave](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/lyx/sweave.pdf).

Now I assume you have read the manual, and have an idea on how LyX actually works with Sweave. To make **knitr** work with LyX, you can use one of the following approaches:

1. hack at `lyxsweave.R` by putting a corresponding (renamed) R script in your user directory; see [README](https://github.com/yihui/lyx/blob/master/README.md) of my [lyx](https://github.com/yihui/lyx/) repository for details; you will lose the Sweave functionality by this approach because the Sweave module does not use Sweave any more (it uses **knitr** instead), so if you do not care about Sweave any more, you can go this way;
2. I have submitted a patch to the LyX team in [ticket 7887](http://www.lyx.org/trac/ticket/7887), and you can check out the LyX source code via SVN, apply the patch, and re-compile LyX from source; this will give you a new module named `Rnw (knitr)`, and the original Sweave module will stay untouched (you can use either module); for those who do not care to wait for a few more days, the patch has been applied in LyX 2.0.3, so the `Rnw (knitr)` module will be ready to use after 2.0.3 is released;

One difference between the two approaches is you use the Sweave module in the first approach (only one module in the system), and the knitr module in the second (two modules exist in the system).

I have been using the development version of LyX, so it is very likely that you are unable to open my LyX examples; in this case, you can open the file with a text editor and change the line `\lyxformat 417` to `\lyxformat 413`, then you should be able to open the file with LyX 2.0.x. If you come from the first approach, you will see an error telling you the knitr module is not available, and you can ignore it first, then go to document settings, remove the knitr module and add the Sweave module.

There are a couple of LyX examples under the [examples directory](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/inst/examples) of the package repository. Remember to check out the bib files as well.

Below is a short video of using **knitr** in LyX:
