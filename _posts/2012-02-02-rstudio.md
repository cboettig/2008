It is still too early for general users to read this page, but one thing for sure is that **knitr** will be supported in RStudio. For those who do not care about the risk of trying a development version, you can download a latest [daily build](http://www.rstudio.org/download/daily/) and enjoy the one-click PDF compilation in RStudio through **knitr**.

Repeat: this is the development version, and general users should wait for a stable release.
